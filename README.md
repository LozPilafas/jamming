# Jamming
A simple app created with  HTML, CSS & React utilising Spotify's API that does the following:

*Logs the user in with their spotify account & obtain auth token

*Use API to search tracks and display results

*Functionality to add these to your playlist 

*Use the API to save these to logged in users account


The current state has been publihed with surge on : http://lozp.surge.sh/
However! The spotify developer account is in developer mode, only allowing accounts that I explicitly specify to use this. - In essence not the public.
